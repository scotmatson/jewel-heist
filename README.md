jewel-heist
===========

Endless runner style game themed after the idea that you are a jewel thief leaping from rooftop-to-rooftop collecting/stealing gems. 

Note: This runs fine on my laptop but has a lot of stuttering and delay when I attempt to play it at work. Most likely due to the large number of objects which exist at one time in the game world.

TODO
====
Audio:
Sound needs to be added for jewel collection
Sound needs to be added for jump
Sound needs to be added for death
Sound needs to be added for long fall colision

Text:
Text needs to be added for number of jewels collected
Text needs to be added for timer ( assuming a timer is made )

Graphics:
Need to calculate reasonable distances for procedurally generated buildings rather than having the entire city exist
from the start.
Death animation is needed.
Some airborne elements would be nice, perhaps helicopters that appear to be shooting at the player.

Thanks to Balmer for providing a great collection of sprites. This probably wasn't how you expected your
blue-pants-man to be used but his run is great for this type of game. http://opengameart.org/content/hero-spritesheets-ars-notoria.

Thanks to the team at http://www.custommapmakers.org/skyboxes.php for maintaining such a dedicated list of quality resources. The skybox I pulled really enhanced the environmental feel of disparity.

The mass of buildings were an asset uploaded to the Unity store by Yemelyan K. https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/13925. Great models and textures.
